ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, machine learning is gradually becoming popular for predictions in all walks of life. In meteorology, it is gradually competing with traditional climate predictions dominated by physical models. This survey aims to consolidate the current understanding of Machine Learning (ML) applications in weather and climate prediction—a field of growing importance across multiple sectors, including agriculture and disaster management. Building upon an exhaustive review of more than 20 methods highlighted in existing literature, this survey pinpointed eight techniques that show particular promise for improving the accuracy of both short-term weather and medium-to-long-term climate forecasts. According to the survey, while ML demonstrates significant capabilities in short-term weather prediction, its application in medium-to-long-term climate forecasting remains limited, constrained by factors such as intricate climate variables and data limitations. Current literature tends to focus narrowly on either short-term weather or medium-to-long-term climate forecasting, often neglecting the relationship between the two, as well as general neglect of modeling structure and recent advances. By providing an integrated analysis of models spanning different time scales, this survey aims to bridge these gaps, thereby serving as a meaningful guide for future interdisciplinary research in this rapidly evolving field.},

  abstract = "There is a growing need for past weather and climate data to
              support science and decision-making. This paper describes the
              compilation and construction of a global multivariable (air
              temperature, pressure, precipitation sum, number of precipitation
              days) monthly instrumental climate database that encompasses a
              substantial body of the known early instrumental time series. The
              dataset contains series compiled from existing databases that
              start before 1890 (though continuing to the present) as well as a
              large amount of newly rescued data. All series underwent a
              quality control procedure and subdaily series were processed to
              monthly mean values. An inventory was compiled, and the
              collection was deduplicated based on coordinates and mutual
              correlations. The data are provided in a common format
              accompanied by the inventory. The collection totals 12452
              meteorological records in 118 countries. The data can be used for
              climate reconstructions and analyses. It is the most
              comprehensive global monthly climate dataset for the
              preindustrial period so far.",
